# Pinecone Reference Architecture Init 

## Overview

This repo is the initial scratch repo for figuring out how to work with Pulumi and define the AWS archtitecture required to get Roie's 
object search through video application stood up and working in a Production-ready manner. 

## Plan 

Once we've figured out Roie's use case and have the infrastructure working properly, we'll generalize this into a generic starting point 
that anyone can use to deploy their own Production-ready high-scale distributed system for creating embeddings and upserting them to Pinecone.
