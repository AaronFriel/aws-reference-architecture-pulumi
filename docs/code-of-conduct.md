Our project community is dedicated to providing a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive experience for everyone. We expect everyone participating in the Pinecone AWS Reference Architecture project to abide by the following principles:

* **Respect**: Treat everyone with respect, kindness, and empathy.
* **Openness and Inclusivity**: Welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities.
* **Communication**: Communicate constructively and avoid demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* **Collaboration**: Work collaboratively with others. Be open to receiving and giving constructive feedback.
* **Responsibility**: Take responsibility for your actions. If you've made a mistake, own up to it and work to resolve it.

Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but isn't limited to:

* Threats or violent language directed against another person.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.

Violations of this code of conduct can result in members being removed from the project. If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers.
